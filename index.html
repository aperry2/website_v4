      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Alan Perry is a Chicago‚Äëbased new media artist, educator, and technosorcerer whose multidisciplinary practice
        traverses creative coding, interactive electronics, video, sculpture, and AI-augmented image-making. He holds a
        BFA in Photo/Image Making from Colorado State University (2013) and an MFA in Art & Technology Studies from the
        School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2019), where he is now a lecturer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Perry‚Äôs work, rooted in media archaeology and speculative poetics, interrogates the ideological and affective
        structures of emergent technologies. Drawing from historical references ranging from wet-plate photography to
        illuminated manuscripts and occult iconography, his projects reveal how ritual and power persist within
        contemporary techno‚Äësystems. As he recontextualizes these traditions through generative code, photogrammetry,
        sketch-driven AI, and CNC fabrication, he asks: how do we perform belief in the devices that surround us, and
        what ancestral forms continue to lodge within their circuits?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        His work has appeared in solo and group exhibitions at SITE Gallery, Logan Arts Grey Center, Black Box Gallery
        (Portland), Ice Cube Gallery (Denver), and the Electronic Arts Gallery in Fort Collins. Recent projects under
        his ‚ÄúMagical Realism: AI Photography‚Äù series were featured in New City Art (February 2025), while earlier
        institutional support included the Art, Science & Culture Initiative Grant from the University of Chicago
        (2019).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In addition to visual production, Perry teaches courses such as <em>Code Sourcery</em> (creative coding) and
        <em>Holography‚Äù</em> at SAIC, imparting technical fluency alongside critical frameworks of media historiography.
        He
        continues to develop work that materializes invisible data structures - encrypted code, smart-speaker voices,
        AI-generated imagery - into rituals, reliquaries, and speculative interfaces. The result is a deeply layered
        practice that re-enchants the archive, illuminating the systems we inhabit and the sorceries we perform through
        technology.
