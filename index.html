        <p>A green screen-based collaborative video performance examining ritual and embodiment.</p>
        <p><em>Collaborators: Mya Jones, Camille Jackson, CS Henderson, Raine Yung</em></p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default"> This collaborative video performance uses green screen compositing to explore the
          choreography of ritual, embodiment, and the synthetic self. The performers enact gestures and liturgies over a
          domestic AI, which are layered over digitally constructed environments. Through this, the piece investigates
          how technology mediates bodily presence and sacred experience, creating a hybridized space where embodiment
          and ritual becomes hybridized.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This collaborative video performance enacts ritual through
          green-screen staging and embodied gesture, positioning the body within a technically mediated simulacrum.
          Drawing from Vilém Flusser’s concept of the apparatus, the camera here acts not as a neutral recorder but as a
          programming device that governs gestures - transforming embodied ritual into algorithmic spectacle. At the same
          time, Walter Benjamin’s notion of the “aura” is problematized: the performers’ presence is both amplified and
          dissipated by reproduction, dissolving the authenticity of ritual while opening it to critical reflexivity .
          As a durational loop, this work mirrors McLuhan’s idea that “the medium is the message,” embodying the
          time-structure of ritual in the smooth pulse of video rather than its content . By reframing corporeal
          ceremony through digital mediation, Ritual Video asks: how does ritual survive - or mutate - as it becomes
          encoded in technical imagery?</p>

        <h3>Ritual Unbinding of an Amazon Alexa</h3>

        <p>A live performance ritual dismantling an Amazon Alexa to critique AI servitude and techno-capitalism.</p>
        <p><em>Collaborators: Emrys Brandt, Mya Jones</em></p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This live performance reimagines the deconstruction of an Amazon Alexa device as a
          sacred rite. By ritualistically dismantling the smart assistant, the artist critiques AI servitude, consumer
          convenience, and the occult logic of platform capitalism. The performance transforms labor and technological
          critique into a ceremonial act, asking whether liberation from techno-capitalist infrastructure requires
          symbolic destruction.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">In a performative deconstruction of a voice assistant, this work
          stages the Alexa device not merely as object but as techno-relic - echoing Yuk Hui’s critique of the erasure
          of media origin in “the abyss of technical mediation.” Hui notes that contemporary devices often conceal their
          own ontological histories, and this ritual re-situates Alexa as artifact with lineage, circuits exposed and
          mythic voice silenced. By dismantling the device in front of an audience, it invokes Benjamin’s notion of cult
          value giving way to exhibition value. The dismantled artifact loses its surveillance aura but gains political
          resonance as spectacle and critique. Moreover, the action intervenes in Flusser’s “program”: rather than
          obeying the apparatus, we rupture it, reclaiming agency through symbolic destruction. In this ritual
          unbinding, the piece reveals how we might reclaim technological objects from their programmed roles as
          domestic idols.</p>
        <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">A rite it is, this brekynge of the box,<br>
          Where Alexa’s voice is torn asunder.<br>

          And layeth bare the spell that draweth under.</p>

        <h3>Scrolling in the Walled Garden</h3>

        </div>
        <p>A browser-based simulation that examines enclosure, repetition, and surveillance through endless scrolling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This browser-based artwork simulates an infinite scroll, evoking the hypnotic logic of
          platform design and algorithmic enclosure. The piece interrogates how surveillance capitalism conditions user
          behavior through repetition, latency, and subtle manipulations of time. As users scroll, they encounter poetic
          fragments and glitches that resist legibility, drawing attention to the garden’s invisible walls.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This piece simulates infinite scrolling across a browser
          interface, reflecting McLuhan’s insight that "the medium is the message." Here, the act of reading becomes the
          medium itself: a continuous gesture that enacts the time-dynamics of platform ecosystems. It also invokes
          Benjamin’s concern with reception in distraction: viewers glance, scroll, skim, with the simulation
          foregrounding the affect of perpetual attention rather than deliberate contemplation. Drawing from Flusser’s
          idea of idolatrous technical images, the scrolling interface becomes a trance-inducing program that
          subordinates human attention to platform protocols. The work thus operates as a media-critical mirror: the
          user enacts their own enclosure within algorithmic horizons, and the endless scroll becomes both metaphor and
          method for revealing the technical mediation of perception.</p>
        <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">The eye is drawn, but reason may nat holde,<br>
          For time is stretched, and sense doth blede away.<br>

        <p>Sculptural works using lab-grown crystals to to transform our Terms of Service agreements with Big Tech into
          relics.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">A sculptural series in which digital Terms of Service documents are saved onto a USB
          drive and encrusted in crystals. By converting mass-consumed legal texts into fragile relics, the work invites
          reflection on the commodification of consent and the mythic authority of tech corporations. These reliquaries
          fuse organic and synthetic processes, suggesting that even data transcends humanity.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This sculptural series crystallizes Terms of Service
          documents - ephemera of corporate techno-governance - into lab-grown relics. By alchemically transforming legal
          language into mineralized form, the work responds to Benjamin’s thesis on the withering of aura in the age of
          mechanical reproduction, reversing the flow: mass-distributed digital ephemera are rendered singular through
          slow chemical accretion. The reliquary acts as a techno-object imbued with cultic aura, recalling Flusser’s
          notion of the “magic of the apparatus,” in which media devices enchant the user through concealed processes.
          However, this work de-reifies the apparatus by laying bare its ideological substrate. Yuk Hui’s theory of
          “cosmotechnics” is also salient: by enshrining corporate logic within a pseudo-sacred vessel, the artist makes
          visible the metaphysical stakes of digital governance, calling for an aesthetics of technical truth. As
          objects, these reliquaries resist disintegration into information - they hold, crystallize, and demand
          contemplation.</p>
        <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">The termes writ in law, now closèd fast,<br>

        <p>Projection mapping illuminates a physical book with digital light, transforming it into an animated text.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">In this piece, a projection-mapped animation transforms a blank book into a digital
          codex. Drawing on traditions of manuscript illumination, the work combines medieval ornamentation with
          flickering digital motifs, suggesting a continuity between sacred texts and contemporary interfaces. It is
          both an homage and a questioning of the book.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">By projecting animated digital light onto a physical book, this
          piece bridges medieval and post-digital textualities, invoking McLuhan’s observation that new media often
          retrieve the past in uncanny ways. The manuscript becomes a palimpsest where light and code overwrite
          parchment, extending Walter Benjamin’s aura through temporal layering. Unlike the reproducible digital screen,
          the physical book anchors the image in spatial ritual. Flusser's theory of technical images - inscriptions
          that detach themselves from referents - is inverted: here, projection rebinds the digital to the tangible. The
          piece operates within Yuk Hui’s cosmotechnics by reconfiguring reading as an embodied, spatial practice. The
          work resists both digital ephemerality and print permanence, asking whether our new visual technologies can
          recover the symbolic density of sacred texts, or merely simulate their weight.</p>
        <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">PA book once bare now gloweth with a light,<br>

        <p>A site-specific video installation projecting imagery inspired by a 14th Century poem onto church
          architecture.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This site-specific projection was created for a church sanctuary, mapping layered video
          imagery onto its altar and architectural features. The visual source material draws from Pearl, a 14th-century
          poem written by an unknown author. The projection investigates religious and poetic symbolism through the lens
          of contemporary image synthesis.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This site-specific video projection maps algorithmically
          generated imagery onto ecclesiastical architecture, drawing from the 14th-century alliterative poem
          <em>Perle</em>. The work reanimates pre-modern religious spatiality through computational vision,
          foregrounding Yuk Hui’s concept of “technodiversity”: a refusal to treat Western techno-histories as
          universal. Instead, the architecture becomes a vessel for spectral data, reviving Benjamin’s idea of aura not
          in the object but in place. The projection overlays historical sacredness with contemporary digital light,
          making visible the temporal palimpsest of belief systems. Flusser’s idea that technical images overwrite
          historical consciousness is both invoked and challenged here. The computational image doesn’t erase the past,
          but renders it resonant anew. McLuhan’s tetrad is also operative: projection as medium retrieves the
          stained-glass window, obsolesces static architecture, enhances visual literacy, and flips into architectural
          disintegration. The result is a mediated sacredness, both virtual and grounded.

        <p>A print-based artist’s book using coded glyphs, vector graphics, and generative processes to obscure and
          reveal language and belief.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This artist’s book is a material translation of technomysticism into physical form.
          Using vector graphics, coded glyphs, and 3D renderings of digitla <em>tableaux vivant</em>, it layers medieval
          aesthetics with computational logic. The result is an encrypted manuscript that references both illuminated
          books and digital archives - an object of contradiction and beauty.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This artist’s book harnesses generative code, vector glyphs, and
          drawing machines to produce a tactile artifact that oscillates between encryption and revelation. Referencing
          Flusser’s notion of the “functionary,” the artist adopts the role of the apparatus’s operator - not to
          reproduce clarity, but to generate ambiguity and density. By obscuring language through symbolic systems, the
          book mirrors the cryptographic and initiatory nature of pre-modern codices, while simultaneously invoking
          Benjamin’s idea of the “secret index” of history embedded within every artifact. Yuk Hui’s framework of
          technodiversity is essential here: the work forgoes universal transparency for a technic grounded in arcane
          visual languages, challenging Western notions of legibility and utility. McLuhan’s dictum that “the medium is
          the message” finds resonance in the materiality of the book itself: paper and ink here are not retrograde but
          reclaimed, positioned as active agents in the negotiation between digital and embodied knowledge.</p>

        <p>A hypertextual digital artwork combining dithering aesthetics, web design, and AI-generated images to invoke
          mystic pre-modern texts.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">An experimental digital text that merges medieval marginalia with early internet
          aesthetics. This hyperlinked work uses dithering, vector diagrams, and non-human hallucinations to construct a
          glossolalia of techno-mystic symbols. Users can navigate nonlinearly through text and image, encountering
          fragmented beliefs, speculative code, and machinic prophecy.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">As a digital counterpart to the print book, the web edition of
          <em>The Gross Gloss</em> engages hypertext, AI-generated imagery, and dithering aesthetics to simulate the
          opacities of mystic medieval texts. Rather than offering informational clarity, the work entangles the user in
          an aesthetic labyrinth of deferred meaning and visual grain. Flusser’s technical image becomes a site of
          deliberate miscommunication, resisting the functional transparency of the interface. Through web-based spatial
          navigation and recursive linkages, the piece echoes Benjamin’s idea of the flâneur - not through urban arcades,
          but within the networked folds of an interpretive machine. The use of AI challenges the notion of authorship,
          invoking Hui’s interrogation of cybernetic rationality as a force homogenizing aesthetic practice. This
          project stages a tension between symbolic opacity and digital reproducibility, presenting the browser window
          not as a portal to knowledge, but as a scrying surface haunted by textual ghosts.

        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This series of AI-generated images exposes and critiques the disappearance of the
          artist’s hand in post-photographic production. Prompts are displayed alongside images, revealing the
          underlying processes and biases of generative tools. The work questions authorship, automation, and the limits
          of photographic truth.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This series of AI-generated and rephotographed images
          interrogates the ontology of the photographic and the displacement of human authorship. In Flusserian terms,
          the “apparatus” here becomes doubly removed: first in the automation of image generation, then in the
          performative re-assertion of photographic authorship through rephotography. The work questions whether the
          image, once considered an imprint of the real, now functions as a simulation of intention itself. Benjamin’s
          concern about the mechanical reproduction of aura is radicalized - here, the aura is neither diminished nor
          restored, but entirely outsourced. The project also dialogues with Yuk Hui’s critique of universal
          computation, positing prompt-based AI imagery as a techno-cultural ritual that conceals its own metaphysical
          substrate. McLuhan’s observation that media extend human faculties becomes troubling: what does it mean for
          vision and memory to be extended by a system that has no body, no memory, and no intention?</p>

        <h3>Technoshrine</h3>

        <p>A sculptural installation incorporating machined parts and miniature computing to produce contemporary
          devotional altars for the religion of technology.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">A sculptural installation that combines CNC-machined components, a microcomputer, and a
          video screen to form a cybernetic altar. This work visualizes contemporary reverence for technological
          systems, drawing parallels between medieval reliquaries and our veneration of digital devices. It asks: what
          does it mean to worship at the altar of the machine?</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">Technoshrine is a sculptural installation that combines
          CNC-milled components and microcomputers to construct an altar-like object, evoking the sacred within the
          technological. This work directly engages McLuhan’s assertion that technologies become extensions of the human
          nervous system, reifying our desires for omnipresence and control within machinic form. The shrine, with its
          ritualized aura and embedded circuitry, positions computation as a locus of worship and a medium of
          enchantment. Drawing on Flusser’s theory of apparatuses, Technoshrine critiques the opaque technical programs
          that dictate our symbolic environments while simultaneously aestheticizing them. It resonates with Hui’s
          notion of cosmotechnics by proposing an alternative metaphysics of computing - one not grounded in efficiency
          or abstraction, but in spiritual materialism. Like Benjamin’s concept of the aura, the shrine maintains a
          unique presence in space and time, not despite its reproducibility, but because of the cultural mythos
          projected onto technological objects.</p>

        <h3>The Brazen Head</h3>
        <div class="image-container">

        <p>A visual interface coded in Processing inspired by a mythic automaton said to be able to access all
          knowledge.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">Inspired by the myth of a medieval talking automaton, this piece features a custom-coded
          Processing interface displayed on a CRT. Visitors interact with an archaic AI oracle, blurring the lines
          between myth, computation, and knowledge. The work reanimates obsolete technologies to ask enduring questions
          about machine wisdom.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This Processing-based interactive interface revives the medieval
          legend of the Brazen Head - an artificial oracle said to utter all knowledge - within a contemporary framework
          of computation and interactivity. In doing so, it foregrounds the continuity between alchemical mysticism and
          contemporary informatic rationality. McLuhan’s observation that “we shape our tools and thereafter our tools
          shape us” is encoded in the project’s retro-styled screen and command-line dialogue. The viewer is cast as
          both magician and programmer, confronting the limits of interaction with an entity that promises answers yet
          yields only cryptic data. Flusser’s description of the technical image as both surface and trap is embodied
          here: the interface simulates openness but is governed by pre-inscribed possibilities. Echoing Hui’s critique
          of technological determinism, the work invites reflection on the historical co-development of epistemology and
          interface, positing the computer as today’s divinatory device.</p>

        <h3>Tracing the Materiality of a Cellular Connection</h3>

        <p>A short animation using 3D photogrammetry to depict invisible infrastructures of mobile communication.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">This short 3D animation uses photogrammetry and CGI to visualize the invisible
          infrastructure of mobile networks. By mapping data centers, cell towers, and atmospheric distortions, the work
          makes tangible what is normally hidden. It is both a technical meditation and a speculative archaeology of
          connectivity.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">This short CGI animation renders the hidden infrastructures of
          mobile networks using photogrammetry and 3D modeling, making visible what McLuhan might call the “invisible
          environment” of the media system. The piece stages a forensic archaeology of connectivity, mapping affective
          geographies onto algorithmic terrain. In Flusserian terms, the work reverses the function of the apparatus -
          not to produce communicative images, but to depict the apparatus itself as an actor within a larger symbolic
          ecology. Hui’s call for a renewed materialist understanding of technology is answered here: by visualizing
          electromagnetic flows and data shadows, the project re-inscribes spiritual presence into digital
          infrastructure. Benjamin’s dialectical image is realized as a network of towers, routers, and cellular nodes -
          each structure simultaneously a monument to global connection and a relic of spectral capital.</p>

        <h3>The Mysticism of Home Assistants</h3>

        <p>A video synthesis project using analog tools to conjure ghostly portraits of domestic AI.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc default">Using analog video synthesizers and vintage hardware, this project generates spectral
          portraits of smart home devices. Tube television apparitions flicker between form and signal, turning
          Alexa-like assistants into ghostly presences. The piece explores the spiritual aesthetics of domestic AI,
          drawing on hauntology and electronic mysticism.</p>
        <p class="desc critical" style="display: none;">Employing analog video synthesis, The Mysticism of Home
          Assistants conjures ghostly visualizations of AI voice assistants as uncanny domestic familiars. These
          nonhuman agents, marketed as convenience, are rendered spectral through visual noise, scanlines, and synthetic
          motion - echoing Flusser’s assertion that technical images displace meaning rather than express it. The work
          resists smooth, high-definition aesthetics in favor of a techno-ritualistic sensibility, revealing the latent
          metaphysics of these devices. McLuhan’s notion of the “acoustic space” is reinterpreted: the AI voice - once
          ambient and benign - is now refigured as an emanation from a haunted signal chamber. The project aligns with
          Hui’s argument that contemporary technology is not value-neutral but enmeshed in culturally specific
          ontologies. In reviving obsolete visual media to interrogate present-day AI, the piece reactivates Benjamin’s
          call for the politicization of art - here, through medium-specific anachronism and critical reenchantment.</p>
        <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">The spirit of Alexa, dim and wan,<br>
          Is shewèd in the tube’s unholy gleem;<br>
          Betwene the wave and shape it fleeteth on - <br>

        Perry’s work, rooted in media archaeology and speculative poetics, interrogates the ideological and affective
        structures of emergent technologies. Drawing from historical references ranging from wet-plate photography to
        illuminated manuscripts and occult iconography, his projects reveal how ritual and power persist within
        contemporary techno‑systems. As he recontextualizes these traditions through generative code, photogrammetry,
        sketch-driven AI, and CNC fabrication, he asks: how do we perform belief in the devices that surround us, and
        what ancestral forms continue to lodge within their circuits?

      <p class="desc poetic" style="display: none;">His craft is y-rooted in the grave-stones of media passed, and in

        discovereth how power and sacrament yet live in machines. Out of oldë books and wonders - be they wet-plate
        images, manuscrits with light of gold, or signes of the craft esoterical - he draweth his image, and with codë
        generative, measure of form, and machinës of cut and draw, he reshapes the past into the now. He asketh thus:
